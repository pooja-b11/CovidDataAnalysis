# Covid Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing COVID-19 data, focusing on vaccinations, deaths, and infection rates across different geographical locations.

## Introduction
The provided SQL queries aim to derive insights from COVID-19 data, particularly focusing on vaccination progress, death counts, infection rates, and their relationship with population demographics. These queries are structured to analyze data from the Portfolio Project database.

## Queries Overview
The SQL queries cover various aspects of COVID-19 data analysis:

### Data Setup: 
Initializing and populating temporary tables or views for subsequent analysis.

### Geographical Analysis: 
Examining COVID-19 statistics based on continents, countries, or states.

### Vaccination Analysis: 
Tracking vaccination progress, including new vaccinations, rolling vaccinations, and percentage of population vaccinated.

### Death Analysis: 
Investigating death counts, mortality rates, and likelihood of death if infected.

### Global Insights: 
Aggregating data to provide global insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination efforts.

### Data Sources
 Tables related to COVID-19 vaccinations (CovidVaccinations) and deaths (CovidDeaths). 
 
 These tables contain information such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, population, and vaccination data.

### Instructions
To execute these queries, ensure access to the Portfolio Project database containing the necessary tables (CovidVaccinations and CovidDeaths). 
Adjust the SQL queries as needed based on the database schema and environment configuration.

### Views and Temp Tables
Additionally, the queries demonstrate the creation of views and temporary tables for organizing and simplifying data manipulation tasks. 
These views and temp tables facilitate further analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data.
